11 bytes - of data - 1st block -fixed block compatible with sensmon  
1 byte - received from node for control printing data there is a word type coded 4 bits for DS and 4 bits for emon phase
10 - (5 sensors) bytes- maximum 10 DS sensors - can be extended or reduced- maximum amount for highest amount of sensors on the node need to be set, all not used bytes will have 0 value
26 bytes - 3 phases data for emon, could be reduced for 1 phase if 1 phase is measured, if you want to measure 1 phase from other node control byte will decide for print correct data
